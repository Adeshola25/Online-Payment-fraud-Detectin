For Blossom Bank Plc


Steps taken  

Data collection: The first step will involve collecting relevant data from the bank's database, including transaction history, customer demographics, and other relevant information.

Data pre-processing: The collected data will then undergo cleaning, normalization, and transformation to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis.

Exploratory data analysis: This step involves examining the data to understand the relationships and patterns between the different variables. This will also help to identify any missing values, outliers, or other anomalies that may impact the model's accuracy.

Feature selection: This step involves selecting the most important variables that will be used to build the predictive model. The aim is to identify variables that have a significant impact on the outcome of the model.

Model selection: A range of machine learning algorithms will be considered for the task of fraud detection. The model with the highest accuracy rate will be selected and fine-tuned to improve its performance.

Model evaluation: The selected model will be evaluated using a range of performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Deployment: The final step is to deploy the model in the bank's systems to start detecting fraudulent transactions in real-time.

Problem faced:

Imbalanced data: Online fraud is often a rare event, resulting in imbalanced data where the number of non-fraudulent transactions significantly outweighs the number of fraudulent transactions. This can lead to models that have high accuracy but poor recall for fraudulent transactions.
